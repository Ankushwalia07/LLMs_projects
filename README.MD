# RAG System Using LLama2 With Hugging Face and PDF Querying With Astra and LangChain

This repository contains two projects:

1. **RAG System Using LLama2 With Hugging Face**: Demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LLama2 with Hugging Face. The RAG system combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to answer questions with contextually relevant information.

2. **PDF Querying With Astra and LangChain**: Implements a question-answering system using Astra DB and LangChain, powered by Vector Search. It allows users to interactively ask questions based on the content of a PDF document and receive answers generated by a pre-trained language model.

## Installation

Each project has its own set of dependencies and setup instructions. Please refer to the respective README files in the project directories for detailed installation instructions.

## Project Structure

- `RAG_System_LLama2_Hugging_Face/`: Contains the code and documentation for the RAG system project.
- `PDF_Querying_Astra_LangChain/`: Contains the code and documentation for the PDF querying project.

## Usage

Each project has its own usage instructions. Please refer to the respective README files in the project directories for detailed usage instructions.


## Acknowledgments

- The RAG system project uses LLama2 with Hugging Face, which builds upon the work of various contributors to the LLama2 and Hugging Face projects.
- The PDF querying project utilizes Astra DB and LangChain, powered by Vector Search. Special thanks to the developers and contributors of these technologies.
